      title: "ðŸ“š My Research"
      subtitle: ""
      text: |-
        My research develops data-driven frameworks at the intersection of innovation, corporate environmental sustainability, and organizational performance. I combine econometrics, machine learning, natural language processing, and network analytics to study how firms communicate, innovate, and respond to societal pressures such as climate change. Much of my work leverages unstructured and distributed data sources, including news, social media, and patents, to uncover insights that traditional datasets often miss. By applying causal inference and computational methods, I aim to advance academic knowledge while providing actionable intelligence for managers and policymakers.
